# Geoapify and OpenWeatherMap APIs in Gathering Place and Weather Data

### Utilization of API calls to gather geospacial data, transform, load as plots and map renders using GeoViews

## Background
> Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

> Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## WeatherPy Instructions
> In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the  OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

> Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Latitude vs. Temperature

- Latitude vs. Humidity

- Latitude vs. Cloudiness

- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

## VacationPy Instructions
> In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

> Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.
